# Linear Regression
 Pure C implementation of linear least squares for regression analysis using the derived normal equations to obtain optimal weights. This is based in part on the [MLPR](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/2017/) module taken at the University of Edinburgh in 2017. The code is currently unoptimised so it should not be used in production, but it will output all transformations throughout execution.

Compile: `gcc -o lreg lreg.c -lm`
